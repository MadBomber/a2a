    <em>Agent-to-Agent Protocol: The Foundation of Interoperable AI Communication</em>
  </p>
</div>

## What is a protocol?

A **communications protocol** is a standardized set of rules and procedures that governs how devices or systems exchange information over a network or communication channel. It defines the format, timing, sequencing, and error handling methods used to ensure reliable and orderly data transmission between participants.

A key component of many communications protocols is the **handshake** - an initial exchange of control messages between communicating parties to establish a connection, negotiate parameters, and confirm readiness before actual data transfer begins. Like a greeting between people, the handshake ensures both sides are present, capable of communicating, and agree on how the conversation will proceed.

For example, in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), a three-way handshake occurs where:
1. One device sends a connection request
2. The receiving device acknowledges and responds with its own parameters
3. The first device confirms, establishing the connection

This handshake mechanism helps ensure data integrity, prevents miscommunication, and establishes a reliable foundation for the information exchange that follows.

This video illustrates the core concept of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol - the handshake between independent AI agents that enables seamless communication and interoperability.
